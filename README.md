# Anime4K

Anime4K is a cutting-edge solution for anime image super-resolution (SR) that utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, combined with a custom-built 4K resolution dataset specifically designed for anime images. This project aims to provide a high-quality solution for enhancing anime content, preserving fine details, maintaining color fidelity, and improving overall image quality.

## Key Features

- **A4K Dataset**: The first 4K resolution dataset tailored specifically for anime super-resolution, which combines perceptual quality and structural complexity.
- **AniFusionNet**: A hybrid CNN-Transformer network architecture that achieves superior performance in anime super-resolution by integrating both local texture modeling and long-range dependency learning.
- **Ground Truth (GT) Enhancement**: A targeted GT enhancement strategy that selectively strengthens hand-drawn line structures, ideal for anime images.
